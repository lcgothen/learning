# Templates

Templates are used to write more generic code. With templates, it's possible to create functions or classes that work with different data types, without having to write different implementations for each.

It's especially interesting that one can create variadic templates - where a function or class can take different amounts and types of arguments -, and full and partial specialized templates - where an implementation can be specified for a specific type or set of types, for all arguments or only some of them.
