# The Vet Clinic

For a lack of imagination, I will take the vet clinic example I used in the C++ Roadmap.

## Plans
1. Make the classes with no methods (skeleton)
2. Add methods and a simple JSON API to register clients, employees and pets (in memory)
3. Integrate with a database (possibly PostgreSQL) using the Entity Framwork.
4. Create a simple UI for registration (possibly using Blazor)

## Possible expansions
- Visualize the registrations in the UI
- Create some search function
- Containerize to split up the application and the database
